LAUNCH

- flash intro page

TODO

- canonical, etc: fill metadata (see defaultRequestModel.js)

PERFORMANCE

- revving
- critical path css inline (https://github.com/pocketjoso/penthouse)

NICETIES

- prettify comment ui
- improve on desktop breakpoints: sidebar
- (author) email composer with subject, intro, and markdown body
- (author) bio editor!
- bio show up as aside box.
- flash should be in layout really?
- cmd + enter look up a lib that has simple api


OBSCURE BUGS

- json when navigating back is SUPER AWKWARD!
- views that respond with json e.g 404, should prob use a taunus method?
