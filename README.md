LAUNCH

- flash intro page

TODO

  - gravatars
  - unsubscribe on all emails
  - (mkt) since always sending out subscription invitations, make them nicer, add feature list.

- (ux) render comments immediately!
- (astro) figure out partial cookie cutter
  - add search input box
  - latest posts sidebar
    - add a button to '/articles/archives'
    - add a button to subscribe

- not ALL the fields
- migration script
- (author) email composer with subject, intro, and markdown body


POST-redeployment

- revving
- further unbloat all.js
- json when navigating back is SUPER AWKWARD!
- views that respond with json e.g 404, should prob use a taunus method?
- flash should be in layout really?
- cmd + enter look up a lib that has simple api
- canonical, etc: fill metadata (see defaultRequestModel.js)
