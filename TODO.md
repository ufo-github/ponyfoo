-------

- latest posts => more than just 6, 8?

- tagging
  - tags per post
  - paged search filter by tag (api/web)
  - tagsoup below latest posts might be nice.

- post regarding css flips (And temporary highlighting, usage of localStorage, maybe separately)


- profiles expansion
  - profile options to reveal or hide: rss/email(in profile and flip card)/git/linkedin (Add provider) / fb / SO
