# A note on everyday usability #

We can learn a lot about usability just by _observing everyday objects_, applications and interfaces. This morning I was flying to London from Buenos Aires, when I realized _something awkward_ about the UI on the plane's in flight system, which allows you to track the progress and duration of the flight, or occasionally watch a movie.

The UI was _mostly in english_, except for a couple of views which were bilingual, that is, english with an spanish translation below. Additionally, a portion of the flight map would, in turn, be displayed in either english or spanish. This was **further aggravated** by the fact that you couldn't really pick a language on the console, so it didn't really help much if you weren't capable of reading english, and if you were, the **half-baked** spanish translations just _got in your way_.

A similar case might be made about the _in flight announcements_. Although I didn't have a problem with these, personally. All of them were first announced in english, and **the important ones** would also be repeated in spanish. I guess you could make a point about how if an announcement is not _**"important enough to require translation"**_, then _it shouldn't be announced in the first place_, but that's _debatable_.

> Either make the experience bilingual in its entirety, or allow users to pick a language, but _stick to one of those_. Be consistent, don't throw a half-baked feature hybrid at your users. It'll just confuse them.

In this particular situation, I learned that **consistency** is really important. Having a consistent UI design would've saved me the mental leap (albeit a small one).

Transitioning back to the web. In my experience, given that I live in _Argentina_, [...]



Luckily, I brought a good book on usability design for this trip, [The Design of Everyday Things](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465067107 "Look up The Design of Everyday Things on Amazon"). I didn't read much of it yet, but I will surely expand on this topic once I get to the end of it.
